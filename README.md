# Overview
This program is designed to allow users to input a PDF syllabus and analyze it using our algorithms, which will grade the document based on found required sections and readability score. The program will produce a report of recommendations and kudos based on what is found and not found, and what is determined as readable or inadequate. This program utilized sentence transformers and Fleish-Kincaid readability scoring to determine the grading of an input syllabus. 

# Installation and Usage
The user should install all packages in the requirements.txt file, and then run SyllabusChecker.py. After this, the user can upload a syllabus with the Upload File button on the program, and select their PDF syllabus from the file explorer. Once selected, the user can press Analyze and wait for the program to produce a report. After the report has loaded, the user can select Save Report to save the produced report as a PDF file of their own. The user can select Upload File button again to upload another syllabus if they desire and repeat the process.
